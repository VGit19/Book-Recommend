# Book-Recommend
Hello Everyone, I made this book recommendation system which recommends book based on description.

First of all you need to have python installed on your system,with its directory mentioned in the environment variables.

To run the project, download all the files and store it in single folder. Unzip the dataset, books.zip, to retrieve csv dataset.

In cmd (to open cmd press windows+R, type cmd and press enter), type pip install -r requirements.txt.

After installation of all the dependecies, type jupyter notebook in cmd and head towards the folder where you have saved the files.

Open book_recomm.py in jupyter notebook and go to cell tab and press "Run All". 

Wait till the processing of all the cells finishes, then head towards last cell and enter the book with correct spelling you want recommendation of.

Top 5 books will be recommended out of dataset.

Thank You!
